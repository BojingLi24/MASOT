1. A disarmed malware source code dataset. 
  6032 specimens, 32 languages, and human-reviewed. 
  It is partly labeled(File Family Vuln Beh Class Pack FUD Unk). 
  We deleted the malicious executables but kept the original VirusTotal reports for each specimen.

2. A detailed visualization tool for malware evolution.
   Overall view: overall trends.
   Detailed view: trace back to a specimen.
